## Description

Learning Compiler Theory and Rust, trying some random ideas...

Project goals:
- Create a statically typed domain-specific compiled language that compiles to the web assembly
- Fast compilation time and easy syntax
- Lightweight runtime
- Should be easy to use as an embedded helper language for scripting or plugin development
